## Why do we model data?

## Why do we model data?

Models have different purposes:

-   Description - What patterns exist in our data?

-   Prediction - Can we forecast outcomes?

-   Understanding - Why do these variables relate?

-   Theory building - Does this match our understanding?

-   Process mapping - How does X lead to Y?

## Regression gives us relationships:

$$Exam = b₀\ +\ b₁ . Facebook\_use_\ +\ ε$$

-   What does b₁ tell us?
-   What doesn't it tell us?

## Regression gives us relationships:

$$Exam = b₀\ +\ b₁ . Facebook\_use_\ +\ ε$$

-   What does b₁ tell us?
    -   That Facebook relates to exam scores.
    -   X is related to Y
-   What doesn't it tell us?
    -   The process behind this relationship.
    -   correlation ≠ causation
    -   Facebook use predicts exam scores ≠ Facebook use changes exam
        scores

## Establishing Causation: Beyond Correlation

**Requirements for causal claims:**

- Temporal precedence (X occurs before Y) 

- Covariation (X and Y are associated) 

- Elimination of alternative explanations

- Converging lines of evidence

**Research approaches:**

- Gold standard: Controlled experiments with random assignment 

- Mediation analysis can be applied with both:

  - Experimental data (strongest causal claims) 

  - Observational data (more limitations/assumptions made)



## Mediation (attempts to) reveal mechanisms:

In terms of a mediator variable M:

-   X affects *M*, which affects Y

-   "Facebook → Study time → Exam scores"

Mediation deals with *how* effects occur (mechanisms).

## 

![](images/mediation.png)

## Moderation (attempts to) reveal conditions:

In terms of a moderator variable Z:

-   The effect of X on Y depends on Z

-   X affects Y differently at different levels of Z

    -   "Facebook usage → Exam scores (relationship strength depends on
        self-discipline)"

Moderation explains *when* / the "context in which" one thing affects
another.

## 

![](images/Moderation.png)

## Mediation is hard to establish

-   Mediation is a hard causal inference task!

    -   Manipulation of and random assignment of X affords causal
        inference/causal claims

        -   However, we rarely do the same for M

            -   Mediation analysis requires theory and subsequent
                experiments to test mediator

## Mediation: Example

-   Does study time mediate the relationship between Facebook usage and
    exam scores?

    -   Implying that the overuse of Facebook prevents people from
        studying, so they do differently on their exam

# Testing Mediation

## Causal Steps - Baron & Kenny (1986)

-   Mediation is tested through three regression models:

::: panel-tabset
## Regression 1

-   Predicting the outcome from the predictor variable
-   X -\> Y
-   c path : total effect

## Regression 2

-   Predicting the mediator from the predictor variable

-   X -\> M

-   a path

## Regression 3

-   Predicting the outcome from both the predictor variable and the
    mediator

-   X+M→Y

-   b path

-   c' (c-prime) path: direct effect
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| 
labels=list(X="Facebook",M="Studying",Y="Exam Score")
statisticalDiagram(4,labels = labels )
```

## Mediation Paths

![](images/IMG_4157.JPG){fig-align="center"}

| Paths |   |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| c: "total effect" of X on Y | Total effect = direct effect + indirect effect |
| a x b = "indirect effect" of X on Y (our mediation effect) | indirect effect = total effect - direct effect |
| $c^\prime$ = "direct effect" of X on Y |  |

## Why take the product of the two coefficients?

![](images/IMG_0B66D4765F33-1.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

-   An intuitive explanation:

    -   A 1 unit increase in M corresponds to a b unit increase in Y
        holding X constant

        -   How much does X change M?

            -   a

-   So if **a = 1/2**, X changes M by 1/2, which then changes Y by b,
    the indirect effect is **(1/2) × b**

## Causal Steps - Baron & Kenny (1986)

-   Traditionally, to show mediation ALL these conditions must be met:

    -   X must significantly predict Y in Step 1

    -   X must significantly predict M in Step 2

    -   M must significantly predict Y controlling for X in Step 3

    -   The effect of X on Y must be reduced in Step 3

        -   If X is no longer significant, you have "full mediation"

        -   If X is still significant, then you have "partial mediation"

            -   Not really used in anymore

## Mediation: c path

```{webr-r}

model1 <- lm(exam ~ facebook, data = master)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
model1 <- lm(exam ~ facebook, data = master)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
model_parameters(model1, digit=3) %>%
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 24) %>%
 row_spec(2, color = "white",
              background = "red")
```

-   The c path (total effect): X --\> Y:

    $b = -0.66, t(237) = -5.16, 95\% CI[-0.91, -0.41], p < .001$

## Mediation: a path

```{webr-r}

model2 <- lm(previous ~ facebook, data = master)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
model2 <- lm(previous ~ facebook, data = master)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
model_parameters(model2, digit=3) %>%
    kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 24) %>%
 row_spec(2, color = "white",
              background = "red")

```

-   The a path: X --\> M:

    $b = -0.21, t(237) = -2.16, 95\% CI[-0.40, -0.02], p = .031$

## Mediation: b, c' path

-   Add in the b (M --\> Y) and c' **(direct)** paths: X + M --\> Y

```{webr-r}

model3 <- lm(exam ~ facebook + previous, data = master)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| 
model3 <- lm(exam ~ facebook + previous, data = master)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#|
model_parameters(model3, digits=3) %>% 
kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 24) %>%
 row_spec(2, color = "white",
              background = "red") %>%
  row_spec(3, color = "white",
              background = "purple")

```

-   c' Path:
    $b = -0.61, t(237) = -4.77, 95\% CI[-0.86, -0.36], p < .001$

-   b Path: $b = 0.26, t(237) = 3.09, 95\% CI[0.09, 0.42], p = .002$

## Mediation: interpretation

-   Facebook usage negatively impacts exam scores (c path = -.66)

-   Facebook usage negatively impacts previous study time (a path =
    -.21)

-   Controlling for Facebook time, previous study time positively
    impacts exam scores (b path = .26)

-   Controlling for previous study time, Facebook usage negatively
    impacts exam scores (c' path = -0.61)

. . .

-   Do we have mediation here?

## Causal Steps - Baron & Kenny (1986)

-   Traditionally, to show mediation ALL these conditions must be met:

    -   X must significantly predict Y in Step 1 ✅

    -   X must significantly predict M in Step 2 ✅

    -   M must significantly predict Y controlling for X in Step 3 ✅

    -   The effect of X on Y must be reduced in Step 3

        -   If X is no longer significant, you have "full mediation"

        -   If X is still significant, then you have "partial mediation"
            ✅

            -   Not really used in anymore

## Issues with causal steps

. . .

-   Indirect effect is inferred rather than directly estimated

. . .

-   Failure to meet a criterion results in game over!

. . .

-   If total effect (path c) is not statistically significant, game does
    not begin

## Joint significance test

-   An edited version of causal steps approach

    -   If a path and b path are significant

        -   Mediation!

-   Some issues:

    -   Indirect effect is inferred rather than directly estimated

    -   Failure to meet a criterion results in game over!

:::

## Testing mediation: Sobel test

-   So, did mediation happen? Is a change from 0.66 to 0.61 important?

-   The Sobel Test:

    $$Z = \frac{a \times b}{\sqrt{b^2 \times SE_a^2 + a^2 \times SE_b^2}}$$

    -   If the indirect effect is larger than the error, we would
        conclude that the addition of the M variable changed the c path

## Sobel Test

```{webr-r}
#sobel
a <- coef(model2)[2]
b <- coef(model3)[3]
SEa <- summary(model2)$coefficients[2,2]
SEb <- summary(model3)$coefficients[3,2]
zscore <- (a*b)/(sqrt((b^2*SEa^2)+(a^2*SEb^2)))
zscore
#two tailed test 
pnorm(abs(zscore), lower.tail = F)*2

```

## Sobel test

```{r}
library(bda)
#conducts sobel test
mediation.test(master$previous,master$facebook,master$exam)
```

-   *Z* = -1.77, *p* = .08

    -   *We would conclude that no mediation had occurred*

::: callout-note
Other tests listed use slightly different denominator formula
:::

## Sobel test

-   Serious problem!

    -   Assumes indirect effect is normally distributed

        -   Not always the case

![](images/IMG_C60929BD11B9-1.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Mediation: Bootstrapping

-   Testing significance of indirect effect (a x b)

    -   Does not assume distribution is normal
    -   More sensitive test = Higher power!

## Mediation: Bootstrapping

-   What it is:

    -   A computer based method for deriving the probability
        distribution for any random variable

-   When to use it:

    -   You do not know the distribution of your variable(s)

-   How to do it:

    -   Run your analysis a bunch of times with a slightly different set
        of observations each time

## Bootstrap: Overview

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
1.  Take a random sample of size n from the sample with replacement
2.  Estimate the indirect effect in this “resample”
3.  Repeat (1) and (2) a total of k times, where k is at least 1,000.
    The larger k, the better. I recommend at least 10,000
4.  Use distribution of the indirect effect over multiple resamples as
    an approximation of the sampling distribution of the indirect effect

## The Bootstrapped CI

-   Using the bootstrap sample we can calculate 95% CI

    -   Percentile bootstrap

        -   Find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of
            the statistic

-   If 0 is included, no mediation

::: callout-note
Variations exist (e.g., ‘bias corrected’ or ‘bias-corrected and
accelerated’ confidence intervals but they do not perform as well as
percentile.)
:::

## Mediation: All together + bootstrapping

-   Do it all with one function

    -   The MeMoBootR package (developed by Erin Buchanon) gives you
        data screening, each step of the mediation, and the
        bootstrapping results!

        -   The data screening does not include accuracy or missing
            data, so that should be completed first

```{r}
#| results: hide
#| 
#| 
devtools::install_github("doomlab/MeMoBootR")
#library(MeMoBootR)
#no missing data allowed
med_results <- mediation1(y = "exam",
                          x = "facebook", 
                          m = "previous", nboot = 1000, 
                          df = master)
```

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

For each of our stages of mediation, you can print out the models:

::: panel-tabset
## Step 1

```{r}
model_parameters(med_results$model1) %>% kable()
```

## Step 2

```{r}

model_parameters((med_results$model2)) %>% kable()
```

## Step 3

```{r}

model_parameters(med_results$model3) %>% kable()
```
:::

## Mediation: MeMoBootR

-   Next, you can get the Sobel test results:

```{r}
med_results$indirect.effect
med_results$z.score
med_results$p.value
```

## Bootstrapping

-   Last, let's get the bootstrapped results:

```{r}
med_results$boot.results
```

## Bootstrapping

-   Returns several type of cis

    -   Percentile bootstrap

```{r}
med_results$boot.ci$percent %>% kable()
```

-   The indirect effect would be reported as: *b* = -0.05, 95%
    CI\[-0.147, -0.001\]

## Within-participant mediation

-   Mediation when X is a within-subject variable

-   Dohle and Siegrist (2014, Exp 1)

    -   Interested in the effect of name complexity on buying drugs

        -   The specific hypothesis is that complex drug names are
            perceived as more hazardous, which makes someone less likely
            to buy the drug

## Within-participant mediation

$$
Y_{2i} - Y_{1i} = c_{11}
$$

with $Y2_i$​−$Y1_i$ the difference score between DV conditions for the
outcome variable for the *i*th observation

$$
M_{2i}-M_{1i} = a_{21}
$$

with $M_{2i}$​−$M1_{1i}​$ the difference score between DV conditions for
the mediator variable for the *i*th observation,

$$Y_{2i} - Y_{1i} = c'_{31} + b_{32}(M_{2i} - M_{1i}) +
  d_{33}[0.5(M_{1i} + M_{2i}) - 0.5(\overline{M_{1} + M_{2}})]$$

Where we have the direct path, mediator diff and mean_diff

## Within-participant mediation

```{r}
data <- JSmediation::dohle_siegrist

within_mdt <- mdt_within(data=data, IV=name, DV= willingness, M=hazardousness,grouping=participant)
```

## Within-participant indirect effect

```{r}

model_fit_with_index <- add_index(within_mdt)

```

## Summary: Mediation

-   What it is: A method for testing hypotheses about why and how x
    predicts y

-   When you use it:

    -   Whenever you would start using words like "because" in your
        introduction section

-   Best approach\*:

    -   Bootstrapping

## Write-up: Mediation

-   a, b paths

-   Direct effect (c')

-   Total effect (c)

-   Indirect effect

-   How did you test indirect effect

    -   Sobel test or Bootstrapping (# bootstrapped samples)

-   Proportion mediated

-   Figure of path diagram

    -   Create in PPT 😱
    -   Use DiagrammeR

## Write up: Multiple mediators

-   Include all indirect effects

-   Total indirect effect

-   Proportion mediated


## Beyond Mediation: Structural Equation Modeling

- What if your theory is more complex than X → M → Y?

  - SEMs = the next level up

    - Statistical technique for testing complex relationships
  
    - Combines path analysis + factor analysis
  
- Mediation: Building block for understanding causal paths

- SEM: Expanded toolbox for complex theories


## Questions Only SEMs Can Answer

- "Does variable A affect outcomes through multiple pathways?"

- "How do latent constructs influence each other?"

- "Which theoretical model better fits our data?"

- "Do variables have reciprocal relationships?"


## SEMs : Challenges
- Requires larger sample sizes

- More complex to interpret

- Easy to misspecify

- Needs stronger theoretical guidance

- Results depend on model specification

## SEMs implementation

- Software options: R (lavaan), AMOS, Mplus

- Start simple - add complexity gradually

## Moderation (attempts to) reveal conditions:

In terms of a moderator variable Z:

-   The effect of X on Y depends on Z

-   X affects Y differently at different levels of Z

    -   "Facebook usage → Exam scores (relationship strength depends on
        self-discipline)"

Moderation explains *when* / the "context in which" one thing affects
another.

## Moderation = just interaction with meaning

- Math is the same, perspective is different.
  
  - In regression: "Is there an effect?"
  
  - In moderation: "When is the effect stronger?" 
    -  Does Z change how X affects Y?

## Moderation = just interaction with meaning

$$Y = b_₀\ +\ b_₁X\ +\ b_₂Z\ +\ b_₃.XZ$$
Assessment depends on estimates of $b_3$

- Significant b₃? Effect changes across Z
- Positive b₃? Effect stronger as Z increases
- Negative b₃? Effect weaker as Z increases

## Visualizations

- Y-axis: Outcome
- X-axis: Predictor

- Break down your data by levels of 'moderator'

  - Parallel => No moderation
  - Buffering => M changes strength (negatively) with increasing levels
  - Enhancement => M changes strength (positively) with increasing levels
  - Cross-over => M changes direction across levels

## Visualizations

- Y-axis: Outcome
- X-axis: Predictor

- Break down your data by levels of 'moderator'

  - Parallel => No moderation
    - _"Facebook hurts everyone's scores equally, regardless of self-discipline."_
  - Buffering => M changes strength (negatively) with increasing levels
    - _"Facebook crushes undisciplined students' scores but barely affects disciplined ones."_
  - Enhancement => M changes strength (positively) with increasing levels
    - _"Facebook helps everyone - but high-discipline students transform it into a powerful learning tool."_
  - Cross-over => M changes direction across levels
    - _"Facebook destroys grades for low-discipline students but boosts scores for disciplined students who use it for study groups"_
